# Overview

Page configuration usage, including default value for each property:

```js
import lupaSearch from "@getlupa/client";

const options = {
  containerSelector: "#searchResultsContainer",
  labels: {
    pageSize: "Page size:",
    sortBy: "Sort by:",
    itemCount: "Items {1} from {2}",
    currency: "â‚¬",
    showMore: "Show more",
    searchResults: "Search Query: ",
    emptyResults: "There are no results for the query:",
    noItemsInPage: "There are no results in this page",
    backToFirstPage: "Go back to the first page",
    mobileFilterButton: "Filter",
    htmlTitleTemplate: "Search Query: '{1}'",
    noResultsSuggestion: "No results found for this query: {1}",
    didYouMean: "Did you mean to search: {1}",
    similarQuery: "Search results for phrase {1}",
    similarQueries: "Similar queries:",
    filteredItemCount: "Filtered items {1} from {2}",
    outOfStock: "Out of stock",
    aiSuggestions: "Other suggestions:",
  },
};

lupaSearch.searchResults(options);
```

- `inputSelector` - css selector to find your search input element;

- `labels.pageSize` - label for page size selector;

- `labels.sortBy` - label for sort selector;

- `labels.itemCount` - label for item count title. `{1}` is replaced by indices of currently visible items, and `{2}` is total number of search results;

- `labels.currency` - label for currency, where price is used;

- `labels.showMore` - pagination label to show more results and go to the next page;

- `labels.searchResults` - a label that is displayed at the top of search results, is appended with a current search query text;

- `labels.emptyResults` - a label to show when search yields no items, is appended with a current search query text;

- `labels.noItemsInPage` - a label to show when there are no items in the current page (this can happen if user manually navigates to the page, outside of the result range);

- `labels.backToFirstPage` - when there are no items in current page, this label will guide user to the first page of the results.

- `labels.mobileFilterButton` - a label of a button that is visible on mobile resolutions and toggles the mobile search result filter sidebar.

- `labels.htmlTitleTemplate` - dynamic web page tab title template. `{1}` is replaced by a current search query text;

- `labels.noResultsSuggestion` - a label to show when search yields no items, but has items for a suggested search query. `{1}` is replaced by a current search query text;

- `labels.didYouMean` - a label to suggest a search query. `{1}` is replaced by a suggested search query;

- `labels.similarQuery` - a label that is displayed on top of the items yielded by a similar to the used search text query. `{1}` is replaced by this similar search query;

- `labels.similarQueries` - a label that is displayed before all the items yielded by the similar queries;

- `labels.filteredItemCount` - special case for item count label, which is shown when at least one filter is active;

- `labels.outOfStock` - product out of stock overlay label;

- `labels.aiSuggestions` - label for similar query with AI suggestions.

# Query parameters

Search result page retrieves and sets these query parameters from/to page url:

- `q` - user search query text;

- `p` - current page number;

- `l` - item limit, equal to page size;

- `s` - sort key;

- `f.{key}` - filter by term facet value. There can be multiple facet keys;

- `fh.{key}` - filter by hierarchical facet value. There can be multiple facet keys;

- `fr.{key}` - filter by range (stats) facet value. The filter value is a range, with values separated by a colon: `fr.price=5:20`;

If you need to hide any of the sections from the search page, just omit it from option configuration.

# Configuration parameters

## Product Grid

```js
const options = {
  grid: {
    columns: {
      xl: 4,
      l: 3,
      md: 2,
      sm: 2,
      xs: 1,
    },
  },
};
```

Configure product grid and number of columns per row on each resolution.

## Breadcrumbs

An list of custom breadcrumb segments, at the top of search page:

```js
const options = {
  breadcrumbs: [{ label: "Home", link: "/" }, { label: "Search Query: {1}" }],
};
```

The above configuration would be rendered like this: `Home / Search Query: Current Query Text`, with their respective links.

- `label` - a label for a breadcrumb segment. The last segment can have a parameter `{1}` that is replaced with a current search query text;

- `link` - an optional link the segment refers to.

## Class map

Additional classes to add to specific elements. Can be used if custom css is not enough to describe the element appearance:

```js
const options = {
  classMap: {
    layoutSelectionGrid: "grid",
    layoutSelectionGridActive: "grid-active",
    layoutSelectionList: "list",
    layoutSelectionListActive: "list-active",
  },
};
```

      },
      display: (doc) => Boolean(doc.hasRating),
    },
    {
      type: "price",
      key: "discountPrice",

      className: "best-offer",
      html: (doc) => {
        return `<div>This is the best offer: ${doc.price}!</div>`;
      },
      display: (doc) => Boolean(doc.isBestOffer),
      action: (document) => {
        console.log("custom element was clicked", document);
      },
    },
  ],

## Sort

```js
const options = {
  sort: [
    {
      key: "priceDesc",
      label: "Price (Descending)",
      default: true,
      config: [{ price: "desc" }],

      config: [{ in_stock: "desc" }, { _relevance: "desc" }],
    },
  ],
};
```

Define any additional options for search result page.

- `pageSizes` - a list of page sizes that user can select from. Default page size comes from a setting in your Search Query;

- `sort` - custom sort options. Custom sort options are appended to the default option, which sorts search results by relevance. Sort options consist of unique sort key (which is used as a query parameter), and sort configuration, with the same syntax as in Search Query configuration. You can define multiple sort properties for one key. `default` option defines which sort value should be selected when no sort query parameters are defined.

## Pagination

```js
const options = {
  sizeSelection: {
    position: {
      top: true,
      bottom: true,
    },
    sizes: [12, 24, 36, 72],
  },
  pageSelection: {
    position: {
      top: false,
      bottom: true,
    },
    display: 5,
  },
};
```

- `sizeSelection` - page size/item limit selection configuration;

  - `sizes` - a list of page sizes that user can select from. Default page size comes from a setting in your Search Query;

  - `position` - where size selection should be displayed: `top`, `bottom` of the results, or both.

- `pageSelection` - pagination display settings;

  - `position` - where page selection should be displayed: `top`, `bottom` of the results, or both.

  - `display` - maximum number of pages to display in pagination;

## Dynamic page sizes

It is possible to configure different page size selection options for different resolutions (If you have a different number of grid columns for `xs`, `md` or `xl` sizes, or just want to have smaller pages for lower resolutions):

```js
const options = {
  sizeSelection: {
    sizes: {
      xs: [12, 24, 36],
      sm: [15, 30, 45, 60],
      md: [15, 30, 45, 60],
      l: [12, 24, 36, 60],
      xl: [15, 30, 45, 60],
    },
  },
};
```

## Toolbar

Control which elements are visible in the toolbar.

```js
const options = {
  toolbar: {
    layoutSelector: true,
    itemSummary: true,
    clearFilters: false,
    totalCount: false,
  },
};
```

- `layoutSelector` - show layout (regular or full page width product cards) selector buttons;

- `itemSummary` - show a short text that displays the number of total items, controlled by label `labels.itemCount`;

- `clearFilters` - show clear all filters button in the toolbar;

- `totalCount` - display total result count value in the search title summary;

## Search title position

Control search title position:

```js
const options = {
  searchTitlePosition: "page-top",
};
```

Available options:

- `search-results-top` - search results title (along with did you mean query) will be displayed at the top of the search results, side by side to the filters sidebar;

- `page-top` - search results title will be displayed at the top of the page, above filters and just below the breadcrumbs. Default option.

## Additional panels

Search results has an ability to display a number of additional product panels, with different query keys and settings, at the top or at the bottom of the main product list. Additional panels can be used to display blog news, recommended products or other items that are related to the main search results. Additional panel items do not have filters or facets and have only simplified pagination settings.

```js
const options = {
  additionalPanels: [
    {
      location: "top",
      queryKey: "",
      initialCountLimit: 2,
      totalCountLimit: 12,
      labels: {
        showMore: "Show more ({1})",
        showLess: "Show less",
      },
      links: {
        details: "/{id}",
      },
      elements: [
        {
          type: "title",
          key: "name",
          maxLines: 2,
        },
        {
          type: "description",
          key: "simplifiedDescription",
          maxLines: 3,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

- `location` - location of the panel. Available values: `top` and `bottom`;

- `queryKey` - query key for the panel;

- `initialCountLimit` - a max number of items to display initially;

- `totalCountLimit` - a max number of items to display when panel is expanded;

- `labels.showMore` - label to expand a panel. `{1}` is replaced with a total number of items, no larger than `totalCountLimit`;

- `labels.showLess` - label to undo expansion of a panel;

- `links.details` - `links.details` - a constructable link that user is redirected to after clicking on an item Use document fields like `id` in curly brackets (`{id}`) to build desired link url.

- `elements` - a list of available elements. Available items and configuration is the same as in the main search result list.

## Disallow empty query

By default, search result pages queries all documents if there is no query string defined. You can disable this functionality with the following option:

```js
const options = {
  disallowEmptyQuery: true,
};
```

## Dynamic data

Sometimes it is not possible to store all of the required data in LupaSearch indices. You can use Dynamic Data functionality to load additional product data from your own API or other sources.

More details can be found here:

- [Dynamic data Box](./dynamic-data.md)

## Event callbacks

Lupa can emit callbacks on certain events:

```ts
const options = {
  // other configuration
  callbacks: {
    onMounted: () => {},
    onSearchResults: (context: CallbackContext) => {},
    onAdditionalPanelResults: (context: CallbackContext) => {},
    onCategoryFilterResults: (context: CallbackContext) => {},
    onUrlQueryChange: (context: CallbackContext) => {},
    onProductClick: (context: CallbackContext) => {},
  },
};
```

- `onSearchResults` - all products loaded;

- `onAdditionalPanelResults` - additional panels loaded;

- `onCategoryFilterResults` - category filter loaded;

- `onUrlQueryChange` - LupaSearch url query changes (page, sort, filter parameters are changed).

Where `CallbackContext` is:

```ts
type CallbackContext = {
  queryKey: string;
  hasResults?: boolean;
  urlQueryString?: string;
  productId?: string;
};
```

## Routing behavior

```js
const options = {
  routingBehavior: "event",
};
```

Search results supports two ways of product card routing `routingBehavior` settings:

- `direct-link` - elements are direct links to the urls, defined in the document object;

- `event` - when user clicks on the product (title or image), a special event `lupaRedirect` is emitted on the window object. The event can then be handled by the plugin user:

```js
window.addEventListener("lupaRedirect", (data) => {
  // data.detail - redirect url
});
```

# Statistics

By using tracking API, the plugin should be able to track these events in the search results page:

- User clicks on any product in main or additional item section and goes to the detail page;

- Product is added to the cart;
